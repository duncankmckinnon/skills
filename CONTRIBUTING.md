## How this repo works

Synced skills are owned by the library they document. Libraries host those skills at `<package-dir>/.agents/skills/<skill-name>/`; this repo is a thin aggregator that mirrors them to two destinations:

- `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<skill>/` — for the Claude Code plugin marketplace.
- `skills/<skill>/` — the standalone copy for [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io).

A daily workflow (`.github/workflows/sync-from-upstream.yml`) clones each upstream listed above, runs `rsync -a --delete` into both destinations, and opens a PR. CI (`scripts/check-skill-sync.sh`) enforces that plugin and standalone skill copies stay byte-identical.

`scripts/logfire-skill-sources.json` is the executable ownership map for the
Logfire catalog. Both upstream sync and mirror validation use it. CI also
checks that every published Logfire skill has an owner and that relative
references resolve inside the assembled catalog.

**Anything you add directly inside a synced skill directory will be wiped on the next sync.** To change synced skill content, send a PR upstream. Everything else in this repo (plugin metadata, repo-root files, `.github/`, `scripts/`) is fine to edit here.

The two locally owned Logfire skills are not upstream sync targets. Edit their
plugin sources here, then mirror them to `skills/`. Do not replace their native
MCP authentication with the CLI's independently authenticated MCP client.

The CLI also ships release-bound SDK/query/UI adaptations. Those are not public
sync sources: do not import them over the SDK owner's files or the native MCP
entrypoints. Migrate shared improvements upstream deliberately; the CLI's
prepared-project and embedded-reference behavior must survive that migration.

For the frontend ownership migration, merge the CLI's plugin-compatible
specialists first, then import them here and verify publication. Only then merge
the SDK change that delegates browser setup to the frontend specialist. Let the
ordinary upstream sync bring those SDK routing changes back here. This avoids
publishing links to unavailable skills or hand-editing an upstream-owned mirror.

## Adding a new skill

1. Ensure the skill exists in the library at `<package-dir>/.agents/skills/<skill-name>/`.
2. Add a `sync_skill` entry to `scripts/sync-from-upstream.sh`.

## Manually triggering a sync

Actions → **Sync skills from upstream** → Run workflow.

## Plugin development

Test a Claude Code plugin locally:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./plugins/logfire
```

After editing a Codex plugin, reload the plugin cache:

```bash
./scripts/reload-codex-plugin.sh logfire
./scripts/reload-codex-plugin.sh logfire-exporter
```

A new Codex conversation may be required for plugin metadata, skills, MCP servers, icons, or hooks to refresh.

While developing the Cursor plugin, symlink the checkout instead of copying it:

```bash
ln -s /absolute/path/to/pydantic/skills/plugins/logfire ~/.cursor/plugins/local/logfire
```

Host-specific metadata lives alongside the shared plugin content:

```text
.claude-plugin/marketplace.json
.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json
.agents/plugins/marketplace.json
plugins/logfire/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
plugins/logfire/.cursor-plugin/plugin.json
plugins/logfire/.codex-plugin/plugin.json
plugins/logfire-exporter/.codex-plugin/plugin.json
```

The Cursor and Codex marketplaces currently list `logfire`; Codex also lists `logfire-exporter`. The `ai` and `pydantic` plugins remain Claude-only plus a standalone cross-agent skill each.
